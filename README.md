## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript



### What I learned

*layout*

The layout of this project is a little tricky. Why? Because you have to think about how to make images stick in place in his container everytime you resize the webpage in order to achieve responsiveness. I understood that one good idea is to use the property `top` , `left` properties with essentially `transform:translate(x,y)` to avoid images to be displayed in disorder throughout the page.


*basic sliding over two pages*

I learn that slide two pages is basically as making one appear and the one other disappear, you set the property `display` in *css* and play with, in *javascript*.
The entire line of code could be seen in the file *scripts.js* of this project.


### Continued development

Usually websites are filled of bunch of cards( more than two) that enhance products, peoples, services all together in one container where each feature is displayed by sliding either to the next or previous feature with  respectively slider button or icon **next** and **previous**.

Then we intend to learn about how to style **CARD SLIDERS**.


### Useful resources

- [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/creating-an-image-slider-using-javascript-html-and-css-only/] - This link give me a clue how to perform sliding card without need of particular library like jQuery or open source such as React.js. It showcases that with a few numbers of cards to slide we can use quite javascript.
